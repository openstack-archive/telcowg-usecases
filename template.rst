=============================
 The title of your use case
=============================

Introduction paragraph -- what function are you attempting to support
with OpenStack?

Glossary
========

Provide a list of acronyms, their expansions, and what they actually mean in
general language here. Define any terms that are specific to your problem
domain. If there are devices, appliances, or software stacks that you expect
to interact with OpenStack, list them here.

Remember: OpenStack is used for a large number of deployments, and
the better you communicate your use case the easier it will be to implement.

Problem description
===================

A detailed description of the problem. This should include the types of
functions that you expect to run on OpenStack and their interactions both
with OpenStack and with external systems.

Examples
--------

In order to explain your use case, if possible, provide an example of a
currently implemented or documented planned solution.

Affected By
-----------

If you are aware of any work in progress that will affect this use case,
please list it here.  Include links to a spec or blueprint or bug report
where applicable.

Requirements
============

Use this section to define the functions that must be available or any
specific technical requirements that exist in order to successfully
support your use case. If there are requirements that are external
to OpenStack, note them as such.

References
----------

If any of your requirements specifically call for the implementation
of a standard or protocol or other well-defined mechanism, use this
section to list them.

Related Use Cases
=================

If there are related use cases that have some overlap in the problem
domain or that you perceive may partially share requirements or a
solution, reference them here.

Gaps
====

This section should be used to provide information on the difference
between requirements that are currently met within OpenStack and
those that are not. Requirements not met by OpenStack but that the
author feels should be addressed by it should be listed here.
If you are already aware of any gaps that exist in OpenStack that
prevent the implementation of this use case, provide them here.
This section can often be left with "None currently known." It is
the purpose of this working group and repository to use the 
use cases presented here to identify what the gaps are.
