=============================
 The title of your use case
=============================

Introduction paragraph -- what function are you attempting to support
with OpenStack?

Glossary
========

Provide a list of acronyms and their expensions here. Define any terms
that are specific to your problem domain. If there are devices, appliances,
or software stacks that you expect to interact with OpenStack, list them
here.
Remember: OpenStack is used for a large number of deployments, and
the better you communicate your use case the easier it will be to implement.

Problem description
===================

A detailed description of the problem. This should include the types of
functions that you expect to run on OpenStack and their interactions both
with OpenStack and with external systems.

Examples
--------

In order to explain your use case, if possible, provide an example of a
currently implemented or documented planned solution.

Gaps
----

If you are already aware of any gaps that exist in OpenStack that
prevent the implementation of this use case, provide them here.

Affected By
-----------

If you are aware of any work in progress that will affect this use case,
please list it here.  Include links to a spec or blueprint or bug report
where applicable.

Requirements
============

Use this section to define the functions that must be available or any
specific technical requirements that exist in order to successfully
support your use case. If there are requirements that are external
to OpenStack, note them as such.

References
----------

If any of your requirements specifically call for the implementation
of a standard or protocol or other well-defined mechanism, use this
section to list them.

Related Use Cases
=================

If there are related use cases that have some overlap in the problem
domain or that you perceive may partially share requirements or a
solution, reference them here.
